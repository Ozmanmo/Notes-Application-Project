# Notes-Application-Project
a simple application for creating and managing "sticky notes," which are notes that can be added, updated, and deleted within the app.
The notes are persisted in the user's local storage in their browser, allowing them to access their notes even after closing and reopening the app. The app includes a button for adding new notes, and each note can be double-clicked to delete it. The notes are represented as textarea elements in the HTML.
